Changelog for package schunk_svh
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Forthcoming
-----------
* Minor change to not copy the Node object without any need.
  -> Also the memory failures are fixed (was a problem within the icl)
* Merge branch 'master' of idsgit.fzi.de:ros/ros_s5fh into merging
* Renamed the Node to avoid ambiguities with the low level controller
  Moved functionality into class structure to get rid of global variables
  NOTE: Currently there is a segfault when node is closed.
  This results from an invalid oder double freeing proably even inside
  the Finger Manager and will probably also leak memory.
  This does not impede the working functionality and will be fixed within this week.
* Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/master'
* add instructions to sed script
* add a tiny ambient part to model materials, since RViz will turn them grey otherwise
* more changes to launch files
* Also renamed the launch files. Seems to be working except for the robot modell and tfs
* Renamed the descriptions as well (untestet). Package name is now
  svh_driver
* Renamed most of the files and hopefully all of the occurences within the source to
  SVH instead of S5FH
* Changed a slight error in multiplication factor.
* Switched from enable to disable flags and
  now transfering it as a vector instead of bitlist.
